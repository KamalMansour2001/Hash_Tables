Here i create a hash tables with An array, linkedlist and a list in C#. The Project have three main functions GET, ADD And REMOVE. 
Which use three diffrent ways of hashing algorithms that hash the input of the key that the user want to add and the program use hashing to both get and remove any key and value of the list, linkedlist and array.
